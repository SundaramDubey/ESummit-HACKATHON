# ESummit/waste management app
waste management app:

The basic idea with this app to post the wastes as food wastes , organic and other wastes to the correct place . 
Often we think by waste management that we are going to deal with waste by selves but no all we have to do is take initiative,
if there is lack of dustbins in your locality then you can put your complain on this app's complain section.
If municipality's employee are not coming after a regular interval you can put your complain here .
But we have also some responsibilities always making a grievance is not a solution . So everyone has to take initiatives.
If, anywhere, you see a heap of garbage / waste at public places then you can just capture it and upload on our waste management app so that an appropriate action can be taken by concerned authorities.  .
Also the articles are related to waste management are added to the front page of app which will be very helpful for everyone's perspective.

We(maze runner) named our app swarat on the basis of "swacch bharat mission".
